    "On weekdays, most drivers will be in Metropolis during the day and in Gotham at night, so toll or no toll, there's not much of a reason for them to go back and forth between those cities at those times.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "On weekends, however, there's a possibility that reimbursement of toll fees could prompt drivers to go back and forth between Gotham and Metropolis since both cities are active on weekends.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I would start with driver activity data in Gotham and Metropolis beginning at 6 p.m. on Fridays and ending at midnight on Monday (end of Sunday). This would make it easier to break down into the following 6-hour shifts:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6 p.m. Friday to midnight<br>\n",
    "Midnight to 6 a.m. Saturday<br>\n",

    "We need to break it down this precisely because a driver could be driving only in Gotham from 9 p.m. Friday until 2 a.m. Saturday, then stop and log back in at 9 p.m. Saturday and drive in Metropolis only. Even though the driver never left cities during either shift, he drove in two cities on Saturday."

    "\n",
    "We would slice the data to include only rides in Gotham and Metropolis during those times. If a driver takes passengers in both cities between 6 p.m. Saturday and midnight, for example, that variable would be a 2. If a driver stays only in Metropolis from midnight to 6 a.m. Sunday, that variable would be 1. The variable in this column of the dataframe would be only 1 or 2 since we will drop drivers who aren't active during a shift.<br>\n",

    "Each sample represents a driver's activity during each of those six-hour shifts. Let's say we have 90,000 samples from before the experiment and 100,000 samples during the experiment. We would put them all in the same dataset and create a permutation replicate that randomly places samples either in the pool of 90K pre-experiment samples or the 100K experiment samples. This way, we treat every sample as if the null hypothesis were true, that there is no difference in driver tendencies between toll reimbursement and non-toll reimbursement.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We create 10,000 of these permutation replicates and plot a histogram of our test statistic from each of these replicates. We would then see where our observed test statistic, the 0.21, falls on this distribution. We then would look for the p-value, the probability of getting a result of at least 0.21 if the null hypothesis were true. If less than 0.05 percent of the test statistic distribution is equal to or greater than 0.21, then we have a p-value of 0.05 or smaller and this would allow us to reject the null hypothesis as the 0.21 test statistic would be considered statistically significant.<br>\n",

    "### Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to be conscious of the time of year in which we conduct the experiment. There's a huge dropoff in rideshare demand between December and January, for example. The 30 days before the experiment and the 30 days of the experiment should occur during the same season so that rideshare demand remains steady. June-July, July-August, September-October or October-November would be good times to conduct the experiment, but not August-September because areas of high summer activity would see a drop in demand after Labor Day."
